SHA-3 (Keccak) Hardware Implementation â€“ FSM-Based Verilog Design

This project implements the SHA-3 hashing algorithm (Keccak-f[1600]) entirely in Verilog HDL, following the sponge construction model. The design is fully modular and uses an FSM (Finite State Machine) for top-level control, making it synthesizable for FPGA or ASIC.
